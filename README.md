My FEWD final project name is called Globe Trekker

Globe Trekker is a travel related website to help new or inexperienced travelers navigate the intricacies of international travel. International travel should be fun and exciting.

In this project I used skills I learned in the General Assembly Front End Web Development class. The skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.
